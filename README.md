# HandWave: Gesture-Based Cursor Control

HandWave is a cutting-edge project designed to allow users to control the cursor on their computer screens using hand gestures. This intuitive gesture-based interface can replace the traditional mouse, enabling a hands-free computing experience. The project combines computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect and interpret user gestures, translating them into precise cursor movements.

## Features

- **Hand Gesture Recognition**: Detects hand gestures using the webcam to control cursor movements.
- **Mouse Control**: Allows users to move the cursor, click, and scroll based on hand gestures.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Gesture recognition and cursor control happen in real time.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple and easy-to-use interface with minimal setup required.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for developing the project.
- **OpenCV**: For real-time image processing and hand detection.
- **MediaPipe**: A framework by Google that provides pre-built models for hand tracking.
- **Machine Learning**: For training the system to accurately recognize various gestures.
## Getting Started

To get started with **HandWave**, follow these instructions:

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.x installed on your machine.
2. Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe
## Running the Application

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HandWave.git
   
2. Navigate into the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd HandWave
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python handwave_cursor_control.py
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to calibrate your hand gestures.
   ## Usage

- **Move Cursor**: Move your hand up, down, left, or right to move the cursor on the screen.
- **Click**: Make a fist to perform a left-click.
- **Scroll**: Move your fingers apart to scroll.

## Customization

- Modify gesture recognition settings for improved accuracy.
- Adjust cursor sensitivity based on personal preference.
