# HandWave: Gesture-Based Cursor Control

HandWave is a cutting-edge project designed to allow users to control the cursor on their computer screens using hand gestures. This intuitive gesture-based interface can replace the traditional mouse, enabling a hands-free computing experience. The project combines computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect and interpret user gestures, translating them into precise cursor movements.

## Features

- **Hand Gesture Recognition**: Detects hand gestures using the webcam to control cursor movements.
- **Mouse Control**: Allows users to move the cursor, click, and scroll based on hand gestures.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Gesture recognition and cursor control happen in real time.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple and easy-to-use interface with minimal setup required.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for developing the project.
- **OpenCV**: For real-time image processing and hand detection.
- **MediaPipe**: A framework by Google that provides pre-built models for hand tracking.
- **Machine Learning**: For training the system to accurately recognize various gestures.
- **Tkinter/GUI Framework**: To create an interface (optional).

## Getting Started

To get started with **HandWave**, follow these instructions:

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.x installed on your machine.
2. Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe
